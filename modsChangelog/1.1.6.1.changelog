Added mods:
-Simple Storage Network
-Custom Main Menu

Changes and fixes:
-Iron Jetpack tweaks:
1. Increased power drain to 833 RF/t on all jetpacks (except the survivalist's jetpack). A 1M RF charge should last 20 minutes.
2. Reduced jetpack speeds across the board. This should encourage you to pick and choose which jetpack you want.
3. Reduced RF capacity of survivalist jetpack (10k > 5k). It will still last about 40 minutes.
