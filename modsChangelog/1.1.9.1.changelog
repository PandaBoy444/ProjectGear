**Mods added:**
-Thaumic Bases
-Thaumic Wonders

**Changes and fixes:**
-Fixed red alloy and electrotine ingots taking WAY too long in an alloy kiln.
-Buffed Worse Solars drastically (2 > 100 RF/t). This should make them better than other truly passive power generators.
-Apathetic mobs now fight back when attacked
-Fixed vanilla bosses not being hostile. All bosses are now hostile even on easy difficulty.
-Disabled the custom recipe for the Industrial Renewal safety belt. It used to be equivilant to diamond armor, but it has been nerfed, so the custom recipe isn't needed.
